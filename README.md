# Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing World Bank country indicator data using SQL. The analysis is performed within a Quarto document (`report.qmd`) which connects to a database, executes a series of SQL queries to explore and transform the data, and presents the results.

## Files

* `report.qmd`: The main Quarto report file containing Python code blocks that execute SQL queries.
* `helpers.py`: A Python module containing utility functions for database connection.
* `.env`: A file to store database credentials (user, password, host, database name).
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Deliverables

1.  **Gradescope:** Submit your GitHub repository URL to Gradescope for autograding.
2.  **Canvas:** Upload the final `report.html` file to Canvas for human review.
